# Book-List-Client
**Author**: Daniel and Jamie
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview

* As a developer, I want to separate the Client UI from the backend API so that my project is thoughtfully organized.
*  As a user, I want to host my app on a reliable, scalable application hosting service so that I can access my mobile app when I'm on the go and share it with others.
* As a developer, I want to deploy the backend API to a hosting service so that other developers may build their own frontend interfaces for this application.
* As a developer, I want to seed my local development database with books so I have data to test my development application with.
* As a developer, I want the client application to have access to a deployed PostgreSQL database so the user data persists across application sessions.
* As a developer, I want the client to have the ability to request all resources from the database through a RESTful endpoint.
* As a user, I want to display all of my books at once so that I can see everything in a single view.
* As a user, I want a view which displays any error messages that occur during the usage of my book list application.
* As a user, I want my books to be rendered dynamically so that I can view all of the books in my list.
* As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my application is easy to navigate.
Add functionality to the book list application for viewing a single book's details and adding a new book the to database. This includes client-side routing using PageJS.
* As a user, I want to request information about a single book so that I can view additional details.
* As a user, I want the ability to add new books to my app so that my collection continues to grow.
* As a user, I want my app to redirect me to the home page on any other endpoint.
* As a user, I want my booklist to be a mobile-friendly single-page application so that I can view it on my mobile device.
* As a user, I want my application to be clean and free of visual distractions so that I can view my books without other content cluttering the viewport.
* As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my application is easy to navigate.
