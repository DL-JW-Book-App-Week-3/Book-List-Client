**Author**: Daniel and Jamie
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
# As a developer, I want to separate the Client UI from the backend API so that my project is thoughtfully organized.
# As a user, I want to host my app on a reliable, scalable application hosting service so that I can access my mobile app when I'm on the go and share it with others.
# As a developer, I want to deploy the backend API to a hosting service so that other developers may build their own frontend interfaces for this application.
# As a developer, I want to seed my local development database with books so I have data to test my development application with.
# As a developer, I want the client application to have access to a deployed PostgreSQL database so the user data persists across application sessions.
# As a developer, I want the client to have the ability to request all resources from the database through a RESTful endpoint.
# As a user, I want to display all of my books at once so that I can see everything in a single view.
# As a user, I want a view which displays any error messages that occur during the usage of my book list application.
# As a user, I want my books to be rendered dynamically so that I can view all of the books in my list.
# As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my application is easy to navigate.
